<details>
<summary><strong>ACCELEDGE | Pune, Maharashtra</strong> - DATA SCIENTIST (Apr 2023 - Present)</summary>

#### VOICE-BOT PLATFORM
- Developed a scalable voicebot integrated with a dialer API to manage outbound call campaigns, tracking 10,000+ queued, active, and completed calls daily via MongoDB and temporary caching.
- Designed and implemented an end-to-end service for real-time audio interactions, integrating speech-to-text transcription, multilingual support, and dynamic conversational behavior using LLM-driven logic and intent classification with JSON-based dialogue mapping.
- Upgraded the system by incorporating GenAI (OpenAI + LangChain) to enable scalable and dynamic response generation, enhancing performance and expanding conversational capabilities.
- Integrated a robust audio response generation pipeline with session-aware memory management to simulate natural, voice-based conversations in diverse languages and user personas.

#### WEB-BOT PLATFORM
- Engineered a scalable Chabot platform for Web-based and WhatsApp based application product configured with a JSON-based architecture, setup for bot flows and deployment on Linux based server.
- Implemented database management with MongoDB for session management, RAG and fine tuning leveraging with LLM and hugging face model to generate language modeling.
- Integrated advanced functionalities into the chatbot platform, including API integration, sentiment analysis, translation mapping, intent classification, multilingual support, and GenAI-driven capabilities.

#### AUDIO PROCESSING AND NLP AUTOMATION
- Built FastAPI microservices for multilingual audio pipelines, incorporating language identification (SpeechBrain), transcription (Google STT, SpeechRecognition), neural translation, and domain-specific NER models, processing over 5,000+ audio files/month.
- Architected APIs with flexible input support (file/base64), token-based security, modular utility functions, and resilient fault handling to ensure scalable deployments and seamless cross-language NLP tasks.

#### DATA SCRAPING AND AUTOMATION
- Developed a Selenium-based web scraping tool to systematically navigate websites and extract updated data files on a daily basis. Automated the workflow using a scheduler to enhance operational efficiency.
- Designed post-processing pipelines for extracted data and established a daily logging system, seamlessly integrating with an SQL database for real-time mapping and visualization on the client dashboard.

<summary><strong>NETWORTH CORP | Bangalore, Karnataka</strong> - DATA SCIENTIST (Feb 2021 - Apr 2023)</summary>

#### TOTAL EXTRACT LOSS OPTIMIZATION
- Led root cause analysis to identify and address factors contributing to yield loss in the Lauter Tun process, employing regression techniques and Shap value-driven feature importance.
- Generated actionable insights from the analysis to define the recommended range of process control parameters for maximization of yield based on analysis of historical data & increased the yield by 0.65%.
- Designed and implemented scalable data models and data pipelines to streamline the storage and analysis of high-volume process datasets.

#### SPACE OPTIMIZATION
- Built an optimization tool to create the best SKU combination for route assembling thereby taking the currently vacant space of truck and minimizing cost.
- Calculated benefits with $300k+ (pesos) from overall monthly from the output files.

#### ELECTRICITY FORECAST IN BREWERIES
- Found patterns of electricity consumption on the MAZ region Brewery dataset, where the records of kilowatts consumed are in every 15 minutes.
- Demonstrated proficiency in time series forecasting techniques, achieving an RMSPE of 37% for ARIMA models and 10% for LSTM models on the validation set.

#### OTHER ACHIEVEMENTS
- Developed and deployed an automation tool for validating MRP controller user details and managing SAP responsibilities, with an optimization module to prioritize cases. Runs daily, auto-handling average of 20 incidents.
- Built an automation tool to monitor SLA breach incidents, send periodic alerts to assignees, and help save priority cases, contributing to an average cost saving of $10M.
